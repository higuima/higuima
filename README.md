Here you can visit my [portfolio](https://higuima.com/), where you can find my work history and some of the most interesting things I am currently studiyng or have already studied (this aplies to math and programming!). 

My latest creation is this [to do list/kanban style application](https://todolist-higuima.streamlit.app/). I used python, mongodb and streamlit to explore the possibilities of creating a database that allows users to create tasks and organize them in a kanban methodology.
